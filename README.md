Road Lane Line detection system ðŸš—.

-This project is based on road safety, lane lines are identified in real time using Image processing technique and Deep learning. It uses old processed (Canny Edge + Hough Transform) in addition to a pre-trained ENet deep learning model for lane detection. This system works well with a range of road conditions, making light of day and night as well as potentially adverse weather to provide robust lane detection.

Key Features

-Integrated OpenCV and PyTorch for Real-time lane detection.

-Traditional for baseline : Deep learning algorithm for challenging scenarios Hybrid

-Lane Segmentation Pre-trained ENet model
